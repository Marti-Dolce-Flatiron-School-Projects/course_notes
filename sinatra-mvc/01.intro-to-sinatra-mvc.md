# Intro To MVC

## Overview

We'll discuss the structure of MVC web applications and explain the
relationship between the different components in this application.

## Objectives

1. List the problems of creating a web application in one file
2. Define and describe the three components- models, views, and controllers- of
   the MVC framework
3. Explain the relationship between models, views, and controllers

## Model-View-Controller

We could create a web application in one file, with thousands of lines of code
in the same document. It would work. But it would also present us with some
very big challenges. It would be close to impossible to debug our program, and
our code would be virtually unreadable.

Instead, we use frameworks, Sinatra being one of them, to separate an
application's code by function and make writing, reading, and debugging code a
much more pleasant and simple experience.

The Model-View-Controller paradigm is a popular way of building frameworks for
web applications - it provides a _separation of concerns_ where groups of files
have specific jobs and interact with each other in very defined ways. In a
nutshell:

* **Models:** The 'logic' of a web application. This is where data is
  manipulated and/or saved.
* **Views:** The 'front-end', user-facing part of a web application - this is
  the only part of the app that the user interacts with directly. Views generally
  consist of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
* **Controllers:** The go-between for models and views. The controller relays
  data from the browser to the application, and from the application to the
  browser.

## The Restaurant Analogy

If you've ever been to a restaurant, you'll know that there is a clear
separation of concerns that takes place. The person cooking the food is not the
same as the person delivering the food, and the person eating the food is
someone completely different. Let's think of MVC as if it were a restaurant.

### Models

First, there are the cooks (the models) that make the food. They take orders
(from the waiter), and prepare the customer's meal. Once ready, they give it to
the waiter to deliver to the customer.

In Sinatra, models are generally written as Ruby classes. Models can also
connect to databases to persist data. Think of models as the main logic behind
your web application.

### Views

The customers place orders and receive plates of food (the views). The orders
are placed with the waiter, who takes them back to the kitchen.

In Sinatra, views are written as `.erb` files, consisting of HTML and embedded
Ruby (Ruby code written within HTML). They are what the user actually sees when
they use your web application.

### Controllers

The waiters (the controllers) shuttle between the kitchen and the front of the
restaurant. They take requests from the customer to the kitchen, and take
prepared meals from the kitchen to the customer. Without the waiter, our
customers would be hungry and our chefs would have nothing to do.

In Sinatra, controllers are written in Ruby and consist of 'routes' that take
requests sent from the browser ("GET this data", "POST that data"), run code
based on those requests by using models, and then render the `.erb` (view) files
for the user to see.
