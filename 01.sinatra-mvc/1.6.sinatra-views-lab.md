## Objectives

1. Respond to HTTP Requests with Sinatra Routes.
2. Render ERB from a Sinatra Action.

## Overview

This lesson practices creating ERB views and rendering them from a Sinatra
Action in response to an HTTP request. Fork and clone this repository and run
`bundle install` to get started!

## Instructions

For each of the following examples, create a `.erb` file in the `views`
directory and a route in `app.rb` which renders that template. Make sure each
template contains the requested content.

Run `shotgun` to start a local server so that you can test your app in your
browser. Once your application is running, assuming port 9393, the shotgun
default, you should be able to hit the following local urls:
http://localhost:9393/hello, http://localhost:9393/goodbye, and
http://localhost:9393/date.

You can run `learn test` to get the tests passing and see errors.

1. Create a template called `hello.erb` in `views` that contains an `h1` tag
   with the content `Hello World`. This should get rendered via a GET `/hello`
   route by your `App` controller in `app.rb`.

2. Create another template called `goodbye.erb` in `views`. In this view, use
   ERB tags to create a variable `name`. This variable should store the name
   `Joe`. Then, using ERB tags, say "Goodbye Joe" in an `h1` tag. This should get
   rendered via a GET `/goodbye` route by your `App` controller in `app.rb`.

3. Create a template called `date.erb` in `views` that gets rendered via GET
   `/date`. It should contain an `h1` with the content `Today`

Using ERB tags, and the [DateTime library](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html),
display today's date in a `p` tag. The date should be formatted to look
something like this `The date is Wednesday, November 18, 2015`.
