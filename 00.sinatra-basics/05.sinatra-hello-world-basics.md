# Sinatra Hello World Basics

## Objectives

2. Write a `get` method.
3. Render a string from that `get` method.

## Instructions

Fork and clone this repository and run `bundle install` to get started!

On your local environment (not in the IDE), run `shotgun` to start a local server so that you
can test your app in your browser. Shotgun default is using port 9393, you
should be able to visit the following url `http://localhost:9393`.

1. Write a `get` method in the `app.rb` file to respond to the root URL '/'.
2. The `get` route should respond with the string `"Hello, World!"`.
