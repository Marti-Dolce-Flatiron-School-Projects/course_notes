# Sinatra Routes Lab

`app.rb` is the heart and soul of our Sinatra application. It handles all the incoming requests from users and directs the browser to the correct URL.

The goal of this lab is to build multiple routes that render different text. You'll be coding your solution in `app.rb`.

## Instructions

We know that to set up a homepage we write our route like this:

```ruby
get '/' do
  "Hello, World!"
end
```

In this example, when the user submits a GET request to load the homepage (the route `/`), the user will see the text `Hello, World!` in their browser.

Your goal for this lab is to set up three different `get` requests that each get processed by a different route.

You'll need to build the following routes:

+ name
+ hometown
+ favorite-song

The `name` route should display "My name is \_\_" in the browser, the `hometown` route should display "My hometown is \_\_", and the `favorite-song` route should display "My favorite song is \_\_".

Don't forget to run `rspec` in terminal to test your code.

## Solution: /config/environment.rb

```ruby

ENV['SINATRA_ENV'] ||= "development"

require 'bundler/setup'
Bundler.require(:default, ENV['SINATRA_ENV'])

require './app'
require_all 'models'
```

## Solution: app.rb

```ruby

# frozen_string_literal: true
# app.rb

require_relative 'config/environment'

class App < Sinatra::Base
  get('/name') do
    'My name is Marti'
  end
  get('/hometown') do
    'My hometown is Florida'
  end
  get('/favorite-song') do
    'My favorite song is Lift Every Voice'
  end
end
```
